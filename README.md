## Political GPS
Political GPS is a program that uses real-time GPS data to display the electoral district you are in and the political party in power. 
Election results and geographic boundary data is stored locally, so no internet connection is required.

Optimized to run on a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) with
 [16x2 LCD RGB backlit display](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10862) and [Adafruit Ultimate GPS module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/746).

## Motivation:
Driving around during an election, the political lean of different parts of the country becomes readily apparent due to 
the abundance of political signage. Huge differences in political affiliation can be observed between neighborhoods that
appear otherwise identical. However, when the election ends and yard signs, banners, and flags are taken down, these
political differences become far less visible. 

I was interested making a tool that revealed these hidden political affiliations as I drove through different neighborhoods. 

## Process:

#### Election data:
Living in Canada, I decided to use the results of the most recent Canadian election, which at the time was the 2015 
federal election. [Geographic boundary data](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/5931f6f0-0008-4b0c-94d7-a1ff596182c5#rate)
for all 338 federal districts were available on the Canadian government website as a shapefile (.shp). 
[Election results](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&dir=rep/off/42gedata&document=summary&lang=e)
by federal district were also available  and were added to the shapefile using GIS software (QGIS).

The geographic data was extremely detailed with over 500,000 vertices. As the project didn’t require such granularity, 
and it would make deploying to a Pi Zero that much more difficult, I decided to simplify the geometry. Using the 
[Douglas-Peucker algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm ), I was able 
to remove 90% of the vertices while maintaining fine geometric detail.

#### District location:
Next, I needed a way to determine if my latitude/longitude coordinate was in a particular district. As districts were 
represented by arrays of vertices, this was a point-in-polygon problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon) 
which I solved using the ray casting (aka crossing number) algorithm. With this, I was able to find my current district 
by checking each district sequentially.

However, there was a problem with several districts that completely encompassed smaller districts (enclaves). 
These encompassing districts were each defined by multiple polygons. A single outer “donut” and one or more inner 
“donut holes” or, given that these are Canadian districts, “Timbits”. If I was located inside one of these holes and I 
only checked the outer donut polygon, I would wrongfully assume I was in the encompassing district rather than the enclave.

| *Enclave district* | 

I solved this problem by first checking whether my location was located in any of the few enclave districts. 
Once enclaved districts were ruled out, I could check just the outer polygons of the remaining districts without issue.

#### Optimization

While checking every district sequentially runs quickly on a desktop, it was far too inefficient to run on a Pi Zero. 
Each point-in-polygon check only has a [time complexity of O(n)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300496000714)
where n is the number of vertices,but because of the large number of vertices and hundreds of districts to check, 
it was still very slow. The geometry simplification certainly helped by reducing 90% of the total vertices, 
but more optimization was needed. 

I decided the best way to reduce the number of districts that needed to be searched was to sort the districts by 
proximity. Specifically, how far my current position was to the center (centroid) of each district. Using QGIS, 
I computed the centroid of each district polygon and added it to my dataset.

| *Distance to district center* |

Calculating the distance between my current position and the centroid of each district was extremely quick. 
Sorting districts by proximity has a time complexity of O(n log n) using Python’s Timsort method. However, following 
the first sort, the order of districts by proximity remains largely stable and only requires limited sorting. 

Together, the optimization from reducing the total vertices and proximity sorting districts was enough that the program 
could run using real-time GPS data on a Pi Zero.
